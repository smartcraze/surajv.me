**GoThrottle** is a **config-driven reverse proxy** that enables distributed rate-limiting with support for global, per-route, and per-IP throttling. It allows developers to enforce traffic limits and dynamic routing **without changing application code**, entirely through a declarative `config.yaml`.

<Note type="danger">
    You must configure your own rate-limits and upstream routes.
</Note>

---

## Project Overview

GoThrottle is a **modular reverse proxy written in Go**, designed for scalability and observability. It uses a **token-bucket algorithm** for request throttling and supports **pluggable storage backends** like Redis or in-memory stores.

Developers can define routing rules, throttle limits, upstream services, and middleware pipelines directly from configuration — making it suitable for distributed, multi-service architectures.

## Key Features

* **Token-Bucket Rate Limiting**  
  Supports global, per-route, and per-IP throttles configurable via YAML.

* **Declarative Routing Layer**  
  Define upstream services, paths, and limits without modifying code.

* **Pluggable Backend Stores**  
  Built-in support for **Redis** and **in-memory** rate limit counters.

* **Middleware Pipeline**  
  Request logging, structured JSON output, panic-safe recovery, and more.

* **Production-Grade Config System**  
  Full control using a single `config.yaml` file.

## Why This Project Matters

GoThrottle demonstrates **backend systems engineering, traffic control, and high-performance Go design**. It highlights practical experience in:

* Building reverse proxies
* Designing middleware pipelines
* Implementing scalable rate-limiting mechanisms
* Managing distributed state with Redis
* Declarative, config-first backend systems

This project reflects the ability to **design production-ready infrastructure components**, essential in API gateways, platform engineering, and SaaS multi-tenant architectures.
