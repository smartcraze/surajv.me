### RapidServe – Vercel-Style App Deployment Platform

**RapidServe** is a **PaaS (Platform as a Service)** that allows developers to deploy full-stack applications directly from their GitHub repositories. It leverages **Docker-based builds, cloud infrastructure, and serverless functions** to provide a fast, scalable, and automated deployment experience — essentially your own mini-Vercel.

**Project Overview:**  
RapidServe is a **Vercel-style deployment platform** that allows developers to deploy full-stack applications directly from GitHub repositories. It automates building, containerizing, and deploying apps, while providing real-time monitoring and scalable cloud infrastructure.

**Key Features:**  
-  **Docker-Based Builds**: Automatically build and deploy containerized apps.  
-  **GitHub Integration**: Auto-deploy from repositories using webhooks.  
-  **AWS Lambda & ECS Support**: Run serverless functions and containerized apps.  
-  **S3 Storage**: Store build artifacts and static assets.  
-  **Reverse Proxy Routing**: Subdomain deployment and traffic management.  
-  **Dashboard UI**: Monitor deployments, view logs, and track build status.  
-  **WebSocket Log Streaming**: Real-time monitoring of builds and app runtime logs.
