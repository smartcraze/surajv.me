### Paytm Clone – Mock Transaction Flow

<Note type="info">
This project is a simulated payment experience built with <strong>Next.js</strong>. It recreates Paytm's order → redirect → callback cycle for learning, prototyping, and demonstration purposes.

## Key Features

| Feature                     | Description                                           |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Simulated Payment Flow      | Full cycle: Create Order → Redirect → Callback       |
| Mock Transaction Status     | Pretend payment results from a gateway               |
| Backend APIs                | Serverless handlers for callback and order logic     |
| Dynamic Routing             | App Router pages for success, loading, and error screens |

## Technologies Used

| Layer       | Tech Stack / Tools             |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| Framework   | Next.js (App Router)           |
| Backend     | Serverless API routes (`/api`) |
| Styling    | Tailwind CSS                   |


## How It Works

```plaintext
User → Create Order → Mock Redirect → Callback API → Success Page
````

| Endpoint                 | Purpose                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| POST `/api/create-order` | Simulates order creation       |
| GET `/redirect`          | Mocks payment redirection page |
| POST `/api/callback`     | Handles fake gateway callback  |
| GET `/success`           | Final screen with success info |


## What I Learned

* Building realistic payment flow simulations
* Handling full redirect-based transactions in Next.js
* Using serverless API routes for backend logic
* Managing asynchronous transitions across UI screens
