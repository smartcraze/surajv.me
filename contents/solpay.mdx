# 💸 Paytm Payment Integration Project

This project is a full-stack implementation of **Paytm Payment Gateway**, designed to handle secure and seamless online transactions for e-commerce or service-based platforms.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **Secure Payment Flow** with checksum-based verification
- ⚡ **Fast Checkout** experience using Paytm’s JS SDK
- 🔄 **Transaction Status Handling** and callback verification
- 📦 **Modular Backend API** for order creation and response validation
- 🔁 **Test Environment Setup** for staging and demo payments

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How payment gateways work under the hood (merchant ID, checksum, callbacks)
- Implementing secure backend logic to avoid tampering
- Creating dynamic HTML forms for POST-based redirects
- Debugging Paytm's sandbox/test environment (yes, it’s *wild*)
- Managing environment variables safely using `.env`
- Handling real-world async flows with payment confirmations

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

```plaintext
[Client Side]
   |
   |-> Calls `/create-order` API
   |
[Node.js Backend]
   |
   |-> Generates Order ID + Checksum
   |-> Responds with payment form data
   |
[Paytm Payment Gateway]
   |
   |-> Handles transaction
   |-> Hits `/callback` with txn status
   |
[Backend]
   |
   |-> Verifies checksum + transaction
   |-> Updates order status in DB
