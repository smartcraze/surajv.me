## About the Event

**Theme: Agentic AI** — in collaboration with **Lightspeed India, AWS, Google Cloud, Sarvam AI, and Bhindi AI**.

We built a web application that helps users explore and learn through various **non-traditional learning methods**, all powered by AI agents.

Along with my teammate **Harsha** ([@webdevharsha](https://github.com/webdevharsha)), we developed a fully functional platform that reimagines how people learn — moving beyond textbooks and lectures into interactive, adaptive, and engaging learning experiences.

## The Experience

This hackathon was an incredible opportunity to work with cutting-edge **agentic AI technologies** and collaborate with industry leaders. The energy in Bangalore was electric, and being part of this innovation-driven event pushed us to think creatively about the future of education.

## What We Built

Our platform leverages **AI agents** to create personalized learning paths that adapt to individual learning styles. Instead of passive content consumption, users engage with:

- **Interactive AI tutors** that understand context and provide real-time guidance
- **Adaptive learning paths** that evolve based on user progress
- **Multi-modal content delivery** — visual, auditory, and kinesthetic approaches
- **Collaborative learning spaces** where AI facilitates peer interactions

## Tech Stack

- **AI/ML**: OpenAI APIs, LangChain for agent orchestration
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, PostgreSQL
- **Cloud**: AWS services for scalable deployment

## Key Takeaways

This hackathon reinforced the importance of **human-centered AI design**. Technology should enhance learning experiences, not replace the human element. Working with Harsha and building something meaningful in such a short timeframe was both challenging and rewarding.
